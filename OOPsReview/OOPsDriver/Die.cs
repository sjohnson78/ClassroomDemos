        // constructors are called indirectly when the outside user creates an instance of the class

        // to create an instance of the class, the outside user will declare the class using the following syntax:
        // class variablename = new class ();
        // "new" is the part of this syntax that is calling the constructor

        //  you may or may not have a constructor for your class

        //  if you do not code a construcor for your class, a default system constructor is executed
        //  this default system constructor initializes your local data members to their default C# values 
        // (for example, the default value for a string is null, the default value for a number is 0, the default value for a bool is false)

        // if you do code a constructor for your class, then YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any and all constructor in the class

        // there are two types of constructors that we use: greedy and default

        public Die()

        }

        // "Greedy" Constructor
        ////////////////////////
